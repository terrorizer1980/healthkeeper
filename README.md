## Inspiration
Data breaches and hacks are becoming more and more of a problem for the public institutions of today. The Healthcare industry is no different and breaches of sensitive healthcare data are arguably even more costly, with organizations losing millions of dollars as well as potentially posing harm to real human lives. Our goal with HealthKeeper is to solve the pitfalls of traditional databases and provide a new solution to preserve and protect this vital data using highly-secure, passwordless, and cost-effective Blockchain protocols. The ultimate goal being to improve healthcare outcomes for us all.

## What it does
Health Keeper allows hospitals and other healthcare organizations to spin up their own Blockchain through the EOSIO software protocol to log a transaction whenever one of the organizations' physicians or faculty wishes to access patient records. The log consists of the physician's/staff's credentials and digital signatures, the patient's unique identifier, and a timestamp that is pushed as a transaction to their pseudo-private blockchain. These logs can then be easily audited by other healthcare bodies and the government, making it that much easier for this organization to comply and verify with best practices.

"You don’t want the health records to be public, but … you DO want a record of everyone who accesses them and … you want to make sure that they are authorized and the ability to retract it." - Daniel Larimer, Block.One

## How we built it
We used the EOSIO software protocol to configure our blockchain and backend for our application. We wrote the C++ Smart Contracts necessary to deploy to our blockchain and push actions to the chain. With our blockchain backend built out, we connected it to a frontend using React and Redux featuring passwordless login functionality and a demo of what this might look like from the Healthcare organization's perspective.

## Challenges we ran into
We had trouble getting everyone up to speed on how to use this new, bleeding-edge tech stack and understanding the fundamentals and use cases of Blockchain technology. Another challenge we ran into is figuring out how we can provide value to the giant Healthcare industry with our software.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
Host our own Blockchain nodes.
Writing a Full-Stack application using our blockchain as our sole backend, and have it successfully interface with React.
Thoughtfully crafted a seamless UX/UI for accessing patient data.
What we learned
Our team was able to gain a firmer grasp of the underpinnings of Blockchain technology as well as get a bigger picture of how the Healthcare industry operates and the problems that plague it. Most importantly, we were able to keep everyone on the same page and finalize our demoes.

## What's next for HealthKeeper
HealthKeeper will roll out its software to participating hospitals and other healthcare institutions for their access records and managing permissions. Our network grows stronger with every new organization as we improve our inter-blockchain communication system to make the data inter-operable between various organizations, while still maintaining consensus and validity of that data. With more time, we would love to extend HealthKeeper's functionality in providing a more secure infrastructure for storing even the patient records themselves in ways that traditional databases have failed in the past.
