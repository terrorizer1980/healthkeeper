                Safe Walk is the new app on the market made 
                for women walking at uncertain times of the day.
                If it's a trip to your dorm from the library, a 
                late walk from the bar/club or even walking 
                home from school, Safe Walk will match you with a 
                walking buddy who is going in the same direction as you.
                For safety reasons we want to make this available to 
                university students only as sort of a test-run and see 
                where it goes from there. Thanks!
            </p>
